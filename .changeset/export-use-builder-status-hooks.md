Export `useBuilderStatus` and `useBuilderConnectFlow` (plus `BuilderConnectFlow` / `BuilderConnectFlowOptions` types) from `@agent-native/core/client`. Both hooks already powered the in-framework SettingsPanel's Builder.io connect flow; surfacing them lets templates reuse the same status read + connect-flow state machine in their own settings UIs without duplicating the SSE / popup-handshake plumbing.
