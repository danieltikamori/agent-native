Fix Builder "Upgrade at builder.io" link in chat dropping users on `/app/projects` instead of billing. The link previously deep-linked to `/app/organizations/<BUILDER_ORG_NAME>/billing`, but `BUILDER_ORG_NAME` is the org's display name (e.g. `Nicholas kipchumba Space`), not a URL-safe slug — Builder's router didn't recognize it and silently redirected to `/app/projects`. The CLI-auth callback doesn't expose an org slug or id today, so the link now always points to `https://builder.io/account/billing`, which resolves the active org from session.
