Real-time sync, take 2: per-source change counters.

The previous attempt — invalidating every active React Query on any non-own change event — caused a request storm on the analytics dashboard (461 pending requests, polls timing out at the 10s abort). This change replaces it with a targeted, default-on mechanism:

- New `useChangeVersion(source)` and `useChangeVersions(sources)` hooks return an integer that advances every time the server emits an event with that source (`"dashboards"`, `"analyses"`, `"action"`, `"settings"`, `"app-state"`, etc.). `useDbSync` keeps a per-source counter and bumps it from every poll/SSE event it sees.
- Templates fold the counter into the relevant React Query `queryKey`. When the source advances, the queryKey changes and React Query refetches that one query — no whole-cache invalidate, no fanned-out refetches across unrelated panels. `placeholderData: (prev) => prev` keeps the old data on screen during the refetch so there's no flicker.
- `useDbSync` reverts to invalidating a small fixed list of framework-internal prefixes (`["action"]`, `["app-state"]`, `["__set_url__"]`, etc.) and no longer touches templates' own data queries. The legacy `queryKeys` option remains in the type signature for backward compatibility but is ignored.
- Analytics' dashboard / analysis / sidebar / command-palette queries are wired up. Other templates can adopt the same pattern by importing `useChangeVersion` and including it in their query keys; recommended sources include `"dashboards"`, `"analyses"`, `"settings"`, and `"action"` (the agent runner emits `source: "action"` after every successful mutating tool call, so depending on it catches any agent-driven change to the underlying data).
