Polish + appearance presets:

- Sign-in page: add a favicon `<link>` to the onboarding sign-in and reset-password HTML so tabs no longer show the default globe.
- Sign-in page: suppress the on-screen Google OAuth status overlay ("OAuth exchange redeemed; returning to the app (flow …)" and friends) for end users. Diagnostics still log to the browser console; the overlay can be opted back in with `#oauth-debug` or `?oauth_debug=1` for debugging.
- Feedback popover: placeholder now leads with concrete examples ("e.g. 'The Send button isn't obvious'…") so users have a clearer prompt than "Tell us what's on your mind…".
- **New: Appearance presets.** Users can pick a color theme without editing source. Adds a `change-appearance` action (auto-mounted everywhere) that the agent can invoke as a tool, a `<AppearancePicker />` React component for Settings pages, a `useAppearance` / `useAppearanceSync` hook pair, and CSS preset overrides (`warm`, `ocean`, `forest`, `rose`, `slate`) layered on top of each template's base palette via `<html data-appearance="…">`. The theme init script now also applies the stored preset on first paint to avoid FOUC.
- Agent system prompt now includes a short first-session personalization flow: greet, ask two yes/no questions (theme preset via `change-appearance` plus one template-specific preference), then mark `application_state.personalization = { done: true }` so it never re-asks.
