/**
 * Safety guards for the Builder autosave contract harness.
 *
 * NON-NEGOTIABLE: this harness may only ever create and mutate brand-new,
 * clearly-named throwaway entries that it created within the same run, in a
 * model that is explicitly test-allowlisted. It must never touch pre-existing
 * content and must never write into a production model. These guards enforce
 * that at the code level so a mistake throws instead of mutating real content.
 *
 * This module is the TRUE single chokepoint: a mutating Builder call is
 * impossible without a `MutableTarget` token, and the only way to obtain one is
 * to go through `ThrowawayRegistry` (which validates the entry name) and a
 * model that passed `assertModelAllowedForLive`. The client mutators in
 * `builder-client.ts` accept a `MutableTarget`, never a bare string id — so the
 * type system itself prevents writing to an unvetted target.
